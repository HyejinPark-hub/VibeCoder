  <h1>ExpireAlarm Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>ExpireAlarm helps you track groceries and their expiration dates. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data. The short answer: we don't collect your personal data. Everything stays on your device or in your iCloud account.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data We Store</h2>
    <p>ExpireAlarm stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>• Food items in your inventory</li>
      <li>• Purchase and expiration dates</li>
      <li>• Item counts and quantities</li>
      <li>• Notes you add to items</li>
      <li>• Photos you attach to items</li>
      <li>• Reminder preferences and alarm times</li>
      <li>• Widget data for Home and Lock screen widgets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of this data is stored on your device or synchronized through your personal iCloud account using CloudKit. We do not have access to any of this information.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>CloudKit Sync and Sharing</h2>
    <p>ExpireAlarm uses Apple's CloudKit to synchronize your data across your devices and enable sharing with others. This synchronization is handled entirely through Apple's iCloud service using your Apple ID. We do not access, process, or store your data on our servers.</p>
    <p>When you share collections with others, the data is stored in private CloudKit database zones that only you and the people you explicitly share with can access.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Apple Intelligence Features</h2>
    <p>On supported devices (iOS 18+ with Apple Intelligence), ExpireAlarm can generate storage tips and recipe ideas using on-device language models. All processing happens entirely on your device—no data is sent to external servers or services.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Vision OCR</h2>
    <p>The "Scan Label" feature uses Apple's Vision framework to extract text from product label photos. This processing happens entirely on your device. We do not store or transmit these images or the extracted text to any external services.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>Free users may see banner ads provided by Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). These ads are displayed within the app interface. Google may collect data for ad personalization and measurement as described in their privacy policy. We do not share your personal data with Google for advertising purposes.</p>
    <p>Pro users who upgrade to remove ads will not see any advertisements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>ExpireAlarm sends local notifications to remind you about expiring items. These notifications are scheduled and delivered entirely by iOS on your device. We do not have access to notification delivery data.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, track, or transmit any personal data. We do not use analytics services, crash reporting tools, or any other data collection mechanisms. Your privacy is our priority.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>ExpireAlarm offers an optional Pro upgrade through Apple's in-app purchase system. Purchase transactions are handled entirely by Apple. We do not receive or store any payment information.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
